<h2>Protocol Verification and State Spaces (September 13)</h2>

<hr>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>Communication protocols constitute critical building blocks in most
modern ICT systems as they define components, rules, and languages
that make data communication possible. The development of correct
communication protocols is a challenging engineering discipline,
making modelling and validation of protocols a key application domain
for the use of Petri nets, concurrency theory, and model checking
technology.  The lectures on this topic will provide a brief
introduction to Coloured Petri Nets (CPNs), Time Petri Nets (TPNs),
and Timed Automata (TA) as languages for constructing formal models of
protocols. Next, the use of explicit state space exploration for
verification of protocols will be covered. This will be followed by a
presentation of the basic approaches to model checking of properties
expressible in (timed) temporal logics, focussing on symbolic
SAT-based verification.  Throughout the lectures, a number of standard
and larger industrial case studies will be used to illustrate how the
presented modeling languages and associated verification techniques
can be applied for the practical verification of protocols.</p>

<h2>Exercises with CPN Tools (on Friday September 17)</h2>

<p>The following exercises are suggested for the practical work
with <a href="http://www.daimi.au.dk/CPNtools/">CPN Tools</a>. The
exercises are taken from
the <a href="http://www.cs.au.dk/CPnets/cpnbook/">CPN book web
page</a>.

<ul>
<li>Exercises 1, 2, and 3 from <a href="http://www.cs.au.dk/CPnets/cpnbook/projects/project0.html">Getting Started with CPN and CPN Tools</a>
<li>Task 1 from <a href="http://www.cs.au.dk/CPnets/cpnbook/projects/project2.html">CPN State Space Analysis</a>
<li>Task 2 or 3 from <a href="http://www.cs.au.dk/CPnets/cpnbook/projects/project1.html">CPN Modelling</a> and Task 2 in <a href="http://www.cs.au.dk/CPnets/cpnbook/projects/project2.html">CPN State Space Analysis</a>

<p>It is recommended to work on the exercises in the order listed
above. There may not be sufficient time at the practical work to complete all the
exercises. </p>

<h2>Presenters </h2>

is Professor in Computer Science and the head of the Theory of
Distributed Systems group at ICS PAS, Warsaw, Poland. He was a
research fellow at the Technical University of Eindhoven and
Manchester University; he also worked as a consultant at AT&T. His
research is now focused on verification methods for Petri nets , timed
automata, and multi-agent systems. He has recently co-authored a book
on verificaition of Time Petri Nets and Timed Automata, published by
Springer-Verlag . He has been a project leader of the EC-founded
project CRIT-2 and played a main role in several national projects. He
has chaired and was a PC member of many conferences on Computer
Science. He is the author of more than 120 conference and journal
articles on temporal logic, verification methods, model checking, and
formal theories of concurrency. His teaching record, besides numerous
regular undergraduate courses, includes two courses at EASSS (European
Agent Systems Summer School). This year he was a co-chair of the Petri
Net conference in Braga, Portugal.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.hib.no/ansatte/lmkr/">Lars Michael
Kristensen</a> is Professor in Informatics and director of the
software technologies for distributed systems research program at
Bergen University College, Norway. He holds a PhD degree in computer
science from Aarhus University in 2000, and has previously held
positions at University of South Australia and Aarhus University. He
has more than 10 years of research experience in the application of
state space methods for verification of communication protocol. A main
focus has been the theoretical foundation of state space methods and
their implementation in computer tools, in particular in the context
of Coloured Petri Nets. A strong focus has also been on applying the
