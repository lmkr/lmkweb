    <h1>Short biography</h1>


<p>
    Lars M. Kristensen received the PhD in computer science from
    University of Aarhus, and is currently professor in computer
    science and software engineering at Western Norway University of
    Applied Sciences. Upon the completion of his PhD, he worked as a
    post-doctoral researcher in computer systems engineering at
    University of South Australia and the Australian Defence Science
    and Technology Organisation concentrating on software tools for
    military planning and on development of real-time avionics mission
    systems. Following the post-doctoral research position, he
    obtained a permanent position at University of Aarhus and was
    involved in a number of industry supported research projects
    within modelling and validation of Internet protocols, mobile
    ad-hoc networks, and sensor networks. He has published more than
    70 papers in strictly referred journal and conferences, is member
    of the Editorial Board of the TopNoC Springer journal, and is a
    member of the steering committee for the International Petri Nets
    conference. He is co-author of the most recent textbook on
    Coloured Petri Net and CPN Tools which is one of the most widely
    used software tools for modelling and validation of concurrent
    systems. In 2007 he received the Danish Research Councils' Young
    Researcher's Award and in 2012 he was awarded the Research and
    Development Award of Bergen University College.</p>
